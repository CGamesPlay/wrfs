// WalkDirFunc is the type of the function called by WalkDir to visit
// each file or directory.

// The path argument contains the argument to WalkDir as a prefix.
// That is, if WalkDir is called with root argument "dir" and finds a file
// named "a" in that directory, the walk function will be called with
// argument "dir/a".
//
// The d argument is the fs.DirEntry for the named path.
//
// The error result returned by the function controls how WalkDir
// continues. If the function returns the special value SkipDir, WalkDir
// skips the current directory (path if d.IsDir() is true, otherwise
// path's parent directory). Otherwise, if the function returns a non-nil
// error, WalkDir stops entirely and returns that error.
//
// The err argument reports an error related to path, signaling that
// WalkDir will not walk into that directory. The function can decide how
// to handle that error; as described earlier, returning the error will
// cause WalkDir to stop walking the entire tree.
//
// WalkDir calls the function with a non-nil err argument in two cases.
//
// First, if the initial fs.Stat on the root directory fails, WalkDir
// calls the function with path set to root, d set to nil, and err set to
// the error from fs.Stat.
//
// Second, if a directory's ReadDir method fails, WalkDir calls the
// function with path set to the directory's path, d set to an
// fs.DirEntry describing the directory, and err set to the error from
// ReadDir. In this second case, the function is called twice with the
// path of the directory: the first call is before the directory read is
// attempted and has err set to nil, giving the function a chance to
// return SkipDir and avoid the ReadDir entirely. The second call is
// after a failed ReadDir and reports the error from ReadDir.
// (If ReadDir succeeds, there is no second call.)
//
// The differences between WalkDirFunc compared to filepath.WalkFunc are:
//
//   - The second argument has type fs.DirEntry instead of fs.FileInfo.
//   - The function is called before reading a directory, to allow SkipDir
//     to bypass the directory read entirely.
//   - If a directory read fails, the function is called a second time
//     for that directory to report the error.
//
type WalkDirFunc = fs.WalkDirFunc

// WalkDir walks the file tree rooted at root, calling fn for each file or
// directory in the tree, including root.
//
// All errors that arise visiting files and directories are filtered by fn:
// see the fs.WalkDirFunc documentation for details.
//
// The files are walked in lexical order, which makes the output deterministic
// but requires WalkDir to read an entire directory into memory before proceeding
// to walk that directory.
//
// WalkDir does not follow symbolic links found in directories,
// but if root itself is a symbolic link, its target will be walked.
